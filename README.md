Hi! I'm a software developer that delivers resourceful attention to detail. I love identifying patterns where others see complexity and using those insights to solve problems.

## Resourceful Attention to Detail

What do I mean by resourceful attention to detail? Enthusiasm and creativity with an analytical perspective. I love to learn, figure things out, and experiment. Whether it's taking a class, learning a new code base, or experimenting with new art mediums, I love the process of being creative and solving problems to create interesting things. In addition, I'm motivated by a determined spirit and a high quality, detail-oriented focus. I sweat the small stuff.

Curious how this translates to finished products? Check out my recent projects below.

## Artistera

## Sushi Attack!
![Sushi Attack](http://www.katarinarossi.com/images/sushi-attack.jpg)

An addicting browser game with flying sushi. Your goal is to dodge the flying sushi, earning points each time a sushi reaches the top of the screen untouched. Each level has a set amount of sushi to clear before moving on to a new kind of faster sushi. Sushi Attack! was implemented with vanilla JavaScript for structure, game logic, and DOM manipulation and HTML5 Canvas & Easel.js for rendering.
